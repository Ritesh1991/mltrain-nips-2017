[Link To Paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/P17-1012.pdf)) for sequence to sequence modeling using Pytorch. While the aim of the tutorial is to make the audience comfortable with pytorch using this tutorial (with a Conv2Seq implementation as an add on), some familiarity with pytorch (or any other deep learning framework) would definitely be a plus. The agenda of this tutorial is as follows:\n",

    "    * A Convolution Encoder with residual connections\n",
    "    * An attention based RNN decoder \n",
    "3. Training subroutines\n",
    "4. Model testing and Visualizations\n",

    "This tutorial draws its content/design heavily from [this](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html) pytorch tutorial for attention based sequence to sequence model for translation. We reuse their data selection/filtering methodology. This helps in focussing more on explaining model architecture and it's translation from formulae to code. "

    "At it's core, an encoder-decoder model uses two neural networks. The first takes in the sentence token by token and produces a sentence representation (A vector of given size, say 512). Once we have this representation (presumably containing the entire semantics of the source sentence), we then use this to generate the corresponding sentence in the target language , word by word. Conventionally, recurrent neural networks have been used for both encoder and decoder [4]  as shown in the figure below ([Image Source](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-01-Visualizing-Representations/))\n",
